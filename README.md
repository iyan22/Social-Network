# Social-Network
Programming project of the subject Data Structures and Algorithms given in second year of Computer Science Engineering in UPV/EHU.

## Introduction
This is a short introduction to the **Programming Project** made by Iyán Álvarez and Davy Wellinger.

The goal of this project is the creation a functional **Social Network** that coordinates people and the relations between them. Implementing not only different basic functions, such as **loading** people and relations into the network or **downloading** it's contents into a ".txt" file, but also utilitarian functions, like simple **searching and sorting**.

In order for the user to interact with the network, we have implemented a simple **console application** that gives the user various interaction options. At the end of the project, we might implement a basic **GUI** to replace this system.

From the programming point of view, we're interested in implementing as many types of \textbf{data structures} as possible, in order to visualise their different strengths and weaknesses and improve the running cost of the program. 

To further understand the data structures implemented in the final version of the project, we decided to first implement everything using **java.util's ArrayList**. This way, upon trying out the different possible data structure, we will be able to see where they excels over each other.

In the end, this Programming Project will be implemented in the most suitable way for the usage of the diverse utilitarian functions: **Searching and Sorting**. And focus on making those processes run smooth and fast.
